## A tool to instantly check the DOM-TREE on mouse right-click

The idea for this tool is to show a snippet of the DOM-TREE instantly on right-click. Without blocking any other functionality. It will show in a seperate block with an idea toenhance it in the future with tools like inspect-parent/inspect-children... Obviously this is meant as a devDependency to help out fellow frontend developers.

MVP:
* Show elements DOM representation on mouse right-click
* Representation is shown in a seperate window without blocking any other functionality
* You can interact with the element in the same way you can in the inspect view

## How to use

The project is submited to npm and should be accessible there. If you face any issues feel free to contact me!

npm install dom-point
